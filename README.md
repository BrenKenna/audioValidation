# audioValidation

Exploring an EMR supported audio validation system with the Python Audio Analysis package. The main elements being explored are how to classify a mock audio signal vs a real audio signal by using "***audio fingerprinting***". Then how to deliver data into this system preferencing the idea that data streaming can act as a funnel before that data touches storage.



The context is a paranoid & fun one, where this system can be deployed alongside bandCloud, allowing the application to validate the audio data it recieves. So that the bandCloud service isn't a glorified malware storage system, with audio data being its vector.
